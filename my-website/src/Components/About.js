            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I'm a San Francisco-based aspiring software engineer. After several years in Management Consulting, and a stint working in mobile user acquisition at a fast-growth start-up, Iâ€™ve discovered a passion for creating things that live on the internet. I am currently a software engineering bootcamp student at <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron</a>, with a planned completion of early October 2021. I am eager to learn and open to new opportunities. </p>
